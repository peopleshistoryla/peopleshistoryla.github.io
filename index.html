                    <h3>Project Abstract</h3>
                    <p>This project seeks to illustrate, highlight and celebrate the stories and experiences of everyday
                    people living in Los Angeles. The project provides an opportunity for  people to tell their stories via video. </p>
                    <p>QR codes will be placed in various locations throughout Los Angeles County. 
                        This web applicaion enables users to scan a QR code with their smart phones, 
                        and access videos of individuals discussing the history of that particular location.  
                        The history spans from the 1970's to 2010.  
                        Users will also have the ability to read about the broader context of 
                        what was occuring in that particular area of Los Angeles County, at any 
                        chosen time between the 1970's and 2010.  </p>

                    <h3>Project Details</h3> 
                    <p>The first phase of this platform will include 20 video stories of different people from across
                        the city -- 5 from west L.A. County i.e. Santa Monica, Culver City, West Hollywood;
                        5 from north L.A. County i.e. Hollywood, Mid Wilshire, Little Ethiopia; 5 from south L.A. County i.e. Inglewood, Baldwin Hills, Crenshaw; 
                        and 5 from east L.A. County i.e. Downtown L.A., Koreatown, Echo Park. 
                        Each story will be geo-tagged and have an accompanying video. </p>
                        
                    <p>Phase 2 will focus on adding additional stories in areas that were not covered in phase one.</p>

                    <h3>Technical Details</h3>
                    <p>This will be a progressive web application, to save people from downloading yet another app. The browser 
                        has Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allow you access to the camera and geolocation data, which are the main APIs this application
                        will consume. We want the geolocation API so that we can pin stories to specific locations and the camera
                        API is needed because we'll want to place custom QR codes around the city near places where the stories
                        take place. This will allow users to scan the QR code and jump right to the relevant video and supplemental
                        info for the story. Users will also be able to browse other stories across that platform. We will most likely
                        have to take advantage of services that will allow streaming video.
