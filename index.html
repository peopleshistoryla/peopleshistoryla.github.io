                    <h3>Project Abstract</h3>
                    <p>This project seeks to illustrate, highlight and celebrate the stories and experiences of everyday
                    people living in Los Angeles. The project provides an oportunity for  people to tell their stories via video. </p>
                    <p>Those videos are then pinned to a physical location in the city and will allow users to play those videos when they are near that location. Since the
                            stories can also be across time, in addition to across the city, the platform will have supplemental 
                            information to let users know the context of how Los Angeles was during the time when this story is being
                            told. </p>
