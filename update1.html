                    <h3>Project Update: July 29, 2018</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Tech updates:</strong> The domain has been purchased and a first iteration of the site is online at <a href="http://www.peopleshistoryofla.com" target="_blank">here.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have not hooked up a database to the site yet, and that is one of next steps for the tech team to handle. 
                        We also have not implemented an admin dashboard for this project yet, but have made a admin login page. If anyone
                        has experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and MongoDB, please connect with me via <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Peoples-History-of-Los-Angeles/">Meetup.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Content updates:</strong> We have not started sourcing for stories yet. Not sure on even how to proceed on this front. Does anyone have any ideas?\
                        Is anyone interested in figuring out how to film these stories? Please speak up in the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Peoples-History-of-Los-Angeles/">Meetup group.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Spoke to a film editor who said that using animations would not be a good idea for the personal stories (this would only be an option if the story was such that the teller didn't want their face associated with it).
                        This is because viewers want to see the emotion on someone's face when they are telling the story.
